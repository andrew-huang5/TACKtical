# TACKtical

TACKtical, is a streamlined business management tool for equestrian professionals. It is specifically designed to assist stable managers in their operations associated with running and maintaining a competitive hunter-jumper equestrian facility. TACKtical is currently being tailored to Arrow Hill Farm for our client Matthew Piccolo. However, we believe that there are many other competitive show stables that have similar organizational needs and may also want to utilize our application.


Our product will be in the form of an iOS application. TACKtical will have three primary components: scheduling, barn data, and metric tracking. The scheduling component of our application is a calendar-like interface that lists all lessons, clinics, shows, training rides, vet and farrier visits. The barn data is the accumulation of all scheduling data into horse, client, and instructor profiles along with any additional entered information for that profile. The final component of our app is a metric tracking and business analytics tool that would track the barn data over time and present it in a helpful visual summary for our client. 


We will be using agile development to create our product.
